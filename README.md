Simple Ajax Components for Wicket
=================================

Wicked has a great support for programming rich Ajax web applications.
It can handle a variety of Ajax callbacks.
Those  calls are non-blocking and are handled asynchronously.
Different elements DOM-tree can be replaced even JavaScript can be injected that way.

But there might be requirements that it does not support right out of the box.
All this flexibility comes to the prize that even the smallest and most simple Ajax page loads about 320 K off Java script files before to does anything.

This little project here aims to give a hint on what to do when resources are scarce and as little bandwidth as posilbe should be used.

Though it has to be said that this comes to another prize.

Only one component at a time can be updated.

Ajax calls are non-asynchronous.

Library is not tested against big variety of web browsers.

Still curious?

Go ahead and take a look for yourself.
